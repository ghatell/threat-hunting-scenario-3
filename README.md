![ChatGPT Image Apr 5, 2025 at 05_11_23 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e02a44b-5802-4618-9142-2a210bf11f69)


## üìö **Scenario:**  
An employee named John Doe, working in a sensitive department, was recently placed on a performance improvement plan (PIP). After displaying concerning behavior, management suspects John may be planning to steal proprietary information and leave the company. The investigation involves analyzing activities on John‚Äôs corporate device (`sa-mde-test-2`) using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE).

## üìä **Incident Summary and Findings**  

### **Timeline Overview**  
1. **üîç Archiving Activity:**  
   - **Observed Behavior:** Frequent creation of `.zip` files in a folder labeled "backup."  
   - **Detection Query (KQL):**  
     ```kql
     DeviceFileEvents
     | top 20 by Timestamp desc
     ```
     ```kql
     DeviceNetworkEvents
     | top 20 by Timestamp desc
     ```
     ```kql
     DeviceProcessEvents
     | top 20 by Timestamp desc
     ```
     ```kql
     DeviceFileEvents
     | where DeviceName == "sa-mde-test-2"
     | where FileName endswith ".zip"
     | order by Timestamp desc
     ```

2. **‚öôÔ∏è Process Analysis:**  
   - **Observed Behavior:** I took one of the instances of a zip file being created, took the timestamp and searched under DeviceProcessEvents for anything happening 2 minutes before the archive was created and 2 mintutes after. I discoverd around the same time. A powershell script silently installed 7zip and then used 7zip to zip up employee data into an archive.
   - **Detection Query (KQL):**  

     ```kql
     let VMName = "sa-mde-test-2";
     let specificTime = datetime(2025-04-02T12:50:01.6274019Z);
     DeviceProcessEvents
     | where Timestamp between ((specificTime - 2m) .. (specificTime + 2m))
     | where DeviceName == VMName
     | order by Timestamp desc
     ```

3. **üåê Network Exfiltration Check:**  
   - **Observed Behavior:** No evidence of data exfiltration via network logs during the time frame.  

   - **Detection Query (KQL):**  

     ```kql
     let VMName = "sa-mde-test-2";
     let specificTime = datetime(2025-04-02T12:50:01.6274019Z);
     DeviceNetworkEvents
     | where Timestamp between ((specificTime - 2m) .. (specificTime + 2m))
     | where DeviceName == VMName
     | order by Timestamp desc
     ```

___     

4. **üìù Response:**  

   - I relayed the information to the employees manager including everything with the archives being created at regular intervals via PowerShell script. There didn‚Äôt appear to be any evidence of exfiltration. Standing by for further instructions from management.

### üßë‚Äçüíª **Next Steps**  
1. Monitor John‚Äôs account activity for unusual access or privilege escalation.  
2. Implement DLP (Data Loss Prevention) measures to alert on potential data exfiltration.  
3. Escalate findings to management and recommend a follow-up review of John's device for additional forensic artifacts.

## Steps to Reproduce:
1. Provision a virtual machine with a public IP address
2. Ensure the device is actively communicating or available on the internet. (Test ping, etc.)
3. Onboard the device to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
4. Verify the relevant logs (e.g., network traffic logs, exposure alerts) are being collected in MDE.
5. Execute the KQL query in the MDE advanced hunting to confirm detection.
